# data science
inclusive analysis
combination of programming, statistics, and domain

## programming
gather and prepare data
stats: R (data specific), Python
databases: SQL (structure query language)
command line interface/terminal: bash (born again shell)
searching: regex, regular expressions to find and reformat data

## math
probability, algebra, linear regression
choose appropriate procedure
diagnose problems

## domain
goals, methods, and limits in a field
implement results from analysis

### machine learning
programming & math without domain
black box model

### research
math & domain without programming
data is already structured, ready for analysis
interpretation of data

### danger zone
domain & programming without math
unlikely to happen
ex) word count, drawing maps

# main steps
planning, data preparation, modeling, follow up
not just a technical field, contextual skills matter

## planning
define and schedule project goals
organize resources
coordination

## data preparation
retrieve, clean, and refine data

## modeling
create a statistical model
validate for accuracy
evaluate to gain insight
refine model (reduce variables)

## follow up
present the model
deploy (ie: a recommendation engine on an app)
revisit to accommodate for changes
archive and document data

# roles
people that work together and make data science possible
very diverse field (in terms of skills, goals, and contexts)

## engineer
hardware and software interfaces
developers, database administrators (DBA)

## big data specialist
machine learning algorithms
computer science & math
data products

## researcher
domain specific (genetics, physics)
very strong statistics

## analyst
good for business
analytics to maximize user input
most data is structured

## business people
manage project
ask relevant questions
how to implement data

## full-stack unicorn
can do everything at an expert level
probably doesn't exist

# teams
programming, statistics, design, business
unicorn: mythical data scientist with universal capabilities
teams combine skill levels and create a "unicorn"

# big data
similar to data science
volume, velocity, and variety
big data + data science = big data science

## big data without data science
don't need tools used in data science
without the three v's
simple analysis, limited domain expertise
ex) machine learning, word count

## data science without big data
data with only one v (volume, velocity, variety)
ex) genetic information has volume 
ex) facial recognition has variety
ex) sensor data has velocity

## big data science
if all three v's are present, you need data science skills
programming, statistics, and domain expertise

# contrasts
what data is not

##  programming
give tasks and commands to a computer, like responding to user input
```python
print("Hello World")
# a simple command in python
```
share some tools and practices
* tools in data science may not be used in programming (ie: Excel)
* statistics differentiates general programming from data science programming

## statistics
most data scientists are not statisticians
machine learning and big data are not subsets of statistics
both analyze data, but different goals, contexts, and people

## business intelligence (BI)
no programming in BI and very limited statistics (ratios, counts)
focus on domain expertise and utility
use dashboards of charts and graphs, data science can learn from BI design

# ethical issues
never do harm
privacy and confidentiality, shouldn't share unless given permissions
copyrights lock down data and prevent you from using it
* some sources were not intended to be shared
* scraping data from websites and other media may not be allowed
must ensure data security for valuable, cleaned and collected data
* concerns of hackers, especially when data isn't anonymous

## potential bias
algorithms are only as neutral as the rules and data
machines are objective and will replicate prejudices found in the data

## over confidence
analysis must simplify data, so people must interpret and apply the data
incomplete algorithms and faulty sampling will create faulty analysis
good judgement is vital
